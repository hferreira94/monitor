# monitor
Simple monitor created as part of a pre-interview dev task to help assess my problem solving and development skills.

This simple shell script contains three small programs in itself that can be used as a quick one-stop to monitor system resources
- Disk Space usage;
- Process checker;
- Connectivity checker;

The idea is to be able to further enhance this code base to include more tools in the future.
